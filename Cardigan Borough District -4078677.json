I have been in business as Plumber in Cardigan for the last twelve years. A business which I have built up by my own personal work \u0026 attention, so it is obvious that in my absence, I could not obtain a substitute to carry it on. I have worked hard for twelve years to obtain this connection so in the event of me having to take on Army Service. When I would return I should naturally have lost all the connection which is the fruit of many years hard application I estimate at present my stock \u0026 tools to be worth at least £30 a stock I can only dispose of by my own labour. As every business man I have also liabilities to meet and debts to collect. I am a married man with a wife \u0026 three children solely dependent on me for their living. One of my children suffering periodically from convulsions requiring both my wife \u0026 selfs constant care \u0026 attention. Here I beg to quote Mr Walter Long's statement that in his instructions to the Tribunals that a head of a small business with three or more dependents upon them was to secure the most lenient consideration. I argue that the decision of the Local Tribunal is far from showing such leniency in my case. My work to a great extent is of national importance inasmuch that it is chiefly in connection with agricultural work such as repairs to pumps \u0026 maintenance of water supplies. Apart from this I am in a public service as Captain of the local fire brigade. \u003cp\u003eSignature of appellant: D. J.
